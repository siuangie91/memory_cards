# Memory Card Game

Solution to [https://github.com/nytm/games-web-code-test](https://github.com/nytm/games-web-code-test)

* Note: *
I am new to Sass + CSS modules. I apologize in advance if the modules are not handled as efficiently as they should be ideally. For example, I had some trouble making my Sass variables global in the framework of the modules, so for the Card component, which is rendered by Board, I put the Sass in Board.scss instead of Card.scss. I will look further into CSS Modules.
